# FantasyPLBot
Automated team-picker for Fantasy Premier League - designed to pick the best performing premium players as well as the best value for money team!

Currently it can automate picking your inital team, and then rank the team based on expected performance, suggesting captain choice and bench setup.

In the future I'm hoping to add in transfer selection, chip selection and much improved predictive tools to try and pick undervalued players!
